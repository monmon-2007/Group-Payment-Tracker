# Group-Payment-Tracker

<p> The idea behind it is a software that runs on the server that allows users to post information to it by accsessing the same file.</P>
<p>it's a Desktop appliction Writen In Java</p>


<p> there is another version of the code writen in c to make it easier to run on windows and Linux systems by only clicking on the excutable file</p>

<h1>TO DO</h1>
The aplication currently runs on the command line window.
I'm planning on assigning a GUI to the app so it becomes easier for the user to utilize.
instead of outputting the data to a text file and the converting it to an excel sheet, I'm planning on applying Apache POI HSSF and XSSF APIs we can read/write both xls and xlsx formats respectively.
